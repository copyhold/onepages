					<h3>Organ Transplant</h3>
					<p>People who need an organ transplant often have to wait a long time for one. Doctors must match donors to recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. This is when the recipient's body turns against the new organ, causing it to fail. People who have transplants must take drugs the rest of their lives to help keep their bodies from rejecting the new organ. Our company can give you solution in kidney, heart, liver transplant.</p>

						<h2>Liver</h2>
						<p>The liver is a resilient, maintenance-free organ that's easy to ignore - until something goes wrong. Because of its wide-ranging responsibilities, the liver often comes under attack by viruses, toxic substances (including alcohol), contaminants and disease.
							<p>Even when it is under siege however, the liver is very slow to complain. Often, people with liver problems will be completely unaware because they may have few, if any, symptoms. The liver is such a stalwart organ that it will continue working even when two thirds of it has been damaged by scarring (cirrhosis).
							 
								<p>While there have been major advances in treating liver diseases, there are no cures. That's why it's important to take steps to prevent liver disease, such as making healthy lifestyle choices and getting immunized against viruses that can cause liver disease.
